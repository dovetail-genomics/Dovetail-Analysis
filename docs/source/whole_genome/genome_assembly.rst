Genome Assembly
===============

Hi-C data plays a crucial role in genome assembly. The 3D structure of the genome captured by the long-range chromatin interactions 
of Hi-C data is vital for the process of scaffolding, where smaller DNA fragments (or contigs) are connected into longer, chromosome-level scaffolds.
This helps to minimize assembly errors and ensures that contigs are placed in their correct order and orientation in the resultant assembled genome.


Compatible Tools
----------------

Libraries generated by Dovetail Genomics kits, such as Omni-C and LinkPrep, are compatible with a wide range of genome assembly and scaffolding tools 
that utilize Hi-C data.
