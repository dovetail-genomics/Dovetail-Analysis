Phasing
=======

Hi-C data plays a crucial role in genome phasing. By capturing long-range chromatin contacts, Hi-C provides linkage information between heterozygous variants that may be separated by megabasesâ€”well beyond the reach of standard short-read phasing methods.
These 3D interaction signals can be used to group alleles into extended haplotype blocks, enabling accurate separation of maternal and paternal chromosomes, resolving complex or repetitive regions, and producing chromosome-scale, phased genomes.
